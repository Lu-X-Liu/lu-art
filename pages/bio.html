                        As a young child Xiao Lu Liu (referred to as Lu below) liked to collect mini toy figures, toy car models, legos as well as stamps, banknotes and coins from foreign countries brought back as gifts by family friends who traveled abroad. She has alway been fascinated with the images on these well designed printed items and the stories behind them. Lu was a creative child and liked to draw images and invent her own toys with cardboard papers, foam board and other materials she could find. When Lu was 12 she received her first sketch book from her mom as a birthday gift. In it she drew and painted her favorite cartoon characters, recreated funny drawings she found in comic books and created her own characters and comic strips. Being creative has always been a need and a source of comfort for Lu. </p>

                        Since her early 20&#39s Xiao Lu Liu started creating art to explore the idea of the inner self. It leads to the discovery of the true self and the false self and the gap between the two. In her art she describes the painful reality of this gap by creating imaginary characters and creatures engaging in seemingly mysterious and sometimes absurd acts. Thought seemingly mysterious, Lu's images are symbolic and meaningful. With these images Lu analyze the root of the false self through parent-child relationship as well as the historic and social background for child development and individual identity forming in China, the country she is from. Unseen trauma has always been an undertone in Lu's work. Thought dark realities can be found in her imagery at times, there is an expressed hope for the impending awakening of the true self for her characters.

                        While her subject matter can seem tragic, Lu never stop having fun with her art. In fact she believes playfulness is one of the most meaningful and important parts of art creation. Lu celebrate playfulness in subject matter and in visual forms. The artist try to find the delicate line that connects playfulness and deep meanings. And in her opinion, through a state of play, art seems to generate a great healing energy that that enables us humans to rediscover, revive, and reinvent ourselves again and again.
